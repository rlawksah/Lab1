UTF-8 stores characters variably in 1 ~ 4 bytes depending on their size, so it can save more memory and storage space than UTF-32. However, the variable length can increase complexity when processing or indexing characters. Since UTF-8 encodes the first 128 characters in the same way as ASCII characters(1 byte), it is compatible with ASCII. On the other hand, UTF-32 stores all characters in fixed 4 bytes, so it has the advantage of being simple and fast to process or index. However, it also has the disadvantage of inefficient memory usage and large file sizes.
There are several reasons why UTF-8 uses a leading "10" after the first byte of a multi-byte code point, the most important of which is to demarcate character boundaries. Since UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, it needs to know how many bytes each character in the string is made up of. The leading byte "10" clearly identifies that the byte is a multi-byte character. If I used three bytes like 1110XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX without the leading "10", it could confuse programs when processing multi-byte characters.
